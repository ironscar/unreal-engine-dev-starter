# Painting Fundamentals

## Brush settings (Photoshop)

- We can choose various brush alphas that are already available
- We can adjust size (shortcut - `[` and `]`)
- We can adjust angle of how the alpha is applied (shortcut - `Shift + left/right arrow`)
- We can adjust roundness of the alpha
  - if the original alpha is set in a circle, it is roundness 100%
  - we can basically squash the alpha to fit it in a thinner ellipse
- We can adjust hardness which specifies how hard the edges of the alpha are
  - this can only be for certain alphas and not all
- We can adjust spacing of the alphas
  - when you drag the brush, the alpha is drawn repeatedly with some spacing
  - more the spacing, more distant and clearly the individual alphas are visible

- All changes are remembered until the same brush is used
  - If you change the brush, the adjustments are not applied
  - Eraser is not treated as a changed brush so coming back from eraser mode remembers changes
- To save adjustments as a new brush, we need to click the `[+]` button at the bottom-right
