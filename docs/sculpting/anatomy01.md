## Male Body proportions

- It is helpful to think of the body proportions in terms of the head
- An average adult male body is `7.5 times` the height of the head
- A adult hero male body is `8 times` the height of the head
- The following landmarks on the body line up with the head if the heads were used as a scale
  - chin (first head)
    - male chins are fairly square
  - nipples (second head)
  - navel & elbows (third head)
    - male navels are more or less circular
  - pelvic base & wrist (fourth head)
    - male pelvis are more or less box-shaped
  - top of knee (fifth head)
  - bottom of knee (sixth head)
  - top of ankle (seventh head)
- The male rib cage has the following characteristics
  - it is `1.2 times` as wide as the height of the head
  - it is `1.5 times` as tall as the height of the head
  - it is tilted backwards by about `30 degrees` from the vertical axis
  - it is egg-shaped from the side
  - it is mostly egg-shaped from the front but has a wide opening of about `90 degrees` from the front-bottom
- The male pelvis has following characteristics
  - it is `1.2 times` as wide as the height of the head
  - it seems to tilt the pelvic region backwards from top by about `30 degrees` from the vertical axis

## Female Body proportions

- Adult female bodies are more curvy than that of males
- An average adult female body is `7 times` the height of the head
- A adult hero female body is `7.5 times` the height of the head
- The following landmarks on the body line up with the head if the heads were used as a scale
  - chin (first head)
    - female chins are more rounded or angular
  - above nipples (second head) 
    - female nipples are slightly lower than that of males of same height
  - below navel and elbows (third head) 
    - female navels are slightly higher than that of males of same height 
    - the elbow and navel still match up
    - female navels are also more vertically oriented
  - pelvic base & wrist (fourth head)
    - female pelvis are trapezium-shaped with wider base
    - the lower part of the butt is wider than the upper
    - the butt also hangs lower than that of males of same height
  - top of knee (fifth head)
  - halfiway calf (sixth head)
    - almost half but slightly higher than that
  - sole of feet (seventh head)
- The female rib cage has following characteristics
  - it is egg-shaped from the side
  - it is mostly egg-shaped from the front but has a wide opening of about `60 degrees` from the front-bottom
  - it is slightly less wide than that of males (but the width/height statistics relative to the head mostly apply)
- The female pelvis has following characteristics
  - it is slightly more than `1.2 times` as wide as the height of the head (wider than males)
  - as a result, the femur is more tilted (from the front) when standing straight
