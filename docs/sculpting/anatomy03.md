# Anatomy 03: Female breast

- Breasts are fat volumes that form a wave-like connection to the middle pectoralis muscle mass
  - on the two sides, it connects almost at the bottom of the middle pectoralis but at the middle, it rises almost to half of it
  - the breast connects back to the body where the lower pectoralis ends (though for larger breasts, they may connect lower)
- Breasts form concave shapes at the top, and then connects back to the body at the bottom in a convex shape
  - it looks nicer when the nipples point almost upwards from where the concave shape starts becoming convex
  - the larger the breast, the lower the nipples tend to point, becoming ever horizontal

## Breast shapes in poses

- Tilted forward
  - when the body is tilted forward
  - gravity acts on the breasts
  - thus, it tends to point towards the ground
  - it can be likened to a pouch with a ball inside, where the ball is stuck between the skin and the rib cage
  - the shape of the breast traces that of the ball at the lower portions and then tapers to the clavicle, as if hanging
  - the larger the breast, the larger the ball, though in larger sizes, the ball is slightly elliptical (longer vertically)
- Flat on chest
  - when lying flat on the chest, the volume gets distributed upwards and out-sideways, due to getting squeezed between the floor and ribcage
- Flat on back
  - when lying flat on the back, the volume tends to flatten out and distribute somewhat down and more outsideways
  - larger the breast, lower it goes and lower the nipples also point towards the down and outside 
- Arched back
  - when the back is arching, the volume tends to get pulled further downwards and sideways as well
  - the smaller the breast, the more it retains its shape from normal upright position
