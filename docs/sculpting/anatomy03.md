# Anatomy 03: Female breast

- Breasts are fat volumes that form a wave-like connection to the middle pectoralis muscle mass
  - on the two sides, it connects almost at the bottom of the middle pectoralis but at the middle, it rises almost to half of it
  - the breast connects back to the body where the lower pectoralis ends
- Breasts form concave shapes at the top, and then connects back to the body at the bottom in a convex shape
  - it looks nicer when the nipples point almost upwards from where the concave shape starts becoming convex
  - the larger the breast, the lower the nipples tend to point, becoming ever horizontal
