# Anantomy 04: Hips

Find the sketches in `Personal Projects/Learnings/skeletal-reference.psd` on the `Anatomy 04` group

- The iliac crest is visible on the side of the body
- The other bone sort of visible on the body is the outside head of the femur
  - this is also called the `greater trochanter`
  - this forms a depression surrounded by multiple muscles

## Male hips

- The male butt is roughly the same volume throughout
- it is somewhat like two letter C's back to back
- the top of the C is the iliac crest
- the crease is where the C's meet
- the center of each C is the corresponding head of the femur
- the front of the pelvic region is slightly wider than the back (hip)
- the small of the back right above the butt doesn't have much fat

## Female hips

- The female butt has a larger volume at the bottom
- instead of a nearly symmetric C, the top of the C is narrower
- similarly, the bottom of the C becomes increasingly thicker
- The existence of subcutaneous (under skin) fat pads also give a curvy shape
- the front of the pelvic region is much wider than the back (hip) than in males
- the small of the back right above the butt has a sometimes-visible diamond-shaped subcutaneous fat pad
