# Anatomy 02: Muscle groups

## Upper body

### Anterior (front) visible bones

Apart from the muscle groups, certain bones also are visible on the front of the body
- `ribs` on skinny individuals, especially at the very bottom where it ends
- `sternum` between the chest muscles
- `clavicle` at the middle and between the chest/deltoid muscle connections
- `illiac spine` of the pelvic bone where the external obliques connect

### Anterior (front) Muscle groups

- `Sternocleidomastoid`: The two muscle tendons that stretch from below the ear, along the neck to the middle of the clavicle
- `Trapezius`: A majorly posterior muscle that is visible on the sides of the neck from the front tapering towards the shoulders
- `Deltoids`: The shoulder muscles that start from the outer one-third of the clavicle and connect into the arm bone
- `Pectoralis`: The chest muscles that begin from below the deltoids and connect to the inner one-third of the clavicle, sternum and ribs as three major tendons respectively
- `Serratus`: A row of muscle tendons that begin from the ribs in the side of the body and connect into the obliques
- `External Obliques`: A large muscle group that begin from the back and interlock with the serratus at the side of the body, ending on either side of the abdomen
- `Abdomen`: Forms the abs with the navel ditributing them into six packs above and one major group that extends towards the pelvis
- `Biceps`: Starts below the pectoralis on the arm and extends downwards towards the elbow's inside
- `Brachialis`: Exists on either side of the biceps and merges into the inside of the elbow
- `Triceps`: A primarily posterior muscle group on the back of the arm but is visible from the front
- `Pronator teres`: A small muscle that is below the brachialis on the side facing the body and merges into the same point where the brachialis but a little further down
- `Brachioradialis`: a major muscle on the forearm facing away from the body below the brachialis and extending downwards
- `Flexor carpi radialis`: A major muscle on the forearm facing towards the body below the Pronator teres and extending downwards
