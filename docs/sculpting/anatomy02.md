# Anatomy 02: Torso Muscle groups

We will cover mainly the torso and upper arms, and some of the lower arm (which will later have its own section)

## Anterior (front) visible bones

Apart from the muscle groups, certain bones also are visible on the front of the body
- `ribs` on skinny individuals, especially at the very bottom where it ends
- `sternum` between the chest muscles
- `clavicle` at the middle and between the chest/deltoid muscle connections
- `illiac spine` of the pelvic bone where the external obliques connect

## Anterior (front) Muscle groups

- `Sternocleidomastoid`: The two muscle tendons that stretch from below the ear, along the neck to the middle of the clavicle
- `Trapezius`: A majorly posterior muscle that is visible on the sides of the neck from the front tapering towards the shoulders
- `Deltoids`: The shoulder muscles that start from the outer one-third of the clavicle and connect half way into the upper arm bone
  - always tapers towards the surface of the arm that is pointed outwards at rest, no matter which way it points during movement
- `Pectoralis`: The chest muscles that begin from below the deltoids and connect to the inner three-fifth of the clavicle, sternum and ribs as three major tendons respectively
  - there is a slight gap on the clavicle between the deltoid and the pectoralis connections
  - there are three main muscle masses for the pectoralis
  - the topmost one on the chest is the bottommost on the arm and the other masses start above it on the arm and twist behind it to go lower on the chest
  - the topmost connects to the inner clavicle, the middle connects to the sternum and the lowest connects to the rib
  - there is a pectoralis minor muscle under the major which connects from the shoulder to some ribs at the bottom of the sternum diagnally, making a bulge at the outer chest
  - as chest muscles become more developed, the clavicle is less and less visible
- `Serratus`: A row of muscle tendons that begin from the ribs in the side of the body and connect into the obliques
  - These tend to cover the ribs on the side/front while starting under the scapula
  - these are rather rounded coming from the side but the interlocking in front is rather flat
- `External Obliques`: A large muscle group that begin from the back and interlock with the serratus at the side of the body, ending on either side of the abdomen
- `Abdomen`: Forms the abs with the navel ditributing them into six packs above and one major group that extends towards the pelvis
  - the bottom boundary of the topmost pair of abs marks the end of the rib cage and follows its shape
  - the abs tend to taper towards the outside and the degree of tilt at the top is more than that of the bottom (at the navel it is almost straight)
- `Biceps`: Starts below the pectoralis on the arm and extends downwards towards the elbow's inside
- `Brachialis`: Exists on either side of the biceps and merges into the inside of the elbow
- `Triceps`: A primarily posterior muscle group on the back of the arm but is visible from the front
- `Pronator teres`: A small muscle that is below the brachialis on the side facing the body and merges into the same point where the brachialis but a little further down
- `Brachioradialis`: a major muscle on the forearm facing away from the body below the brachialis and extending downwards
- `Flexor carpi radialis`: A major muscle on the forearm facing towards the body below the Pronator teres and extending downwards

## Posterior (back) visible bones

Apart from the muscle groups, certain bones also are visible on the back of the body
- `seventh vertebrae` visible at the back of the neck where the trapezius muscle thins out
- `scapula` (shoulder blade) is visible on either side of the back, connecting several muscles
- `illiac spine` of the pelvic bone where the glutes begin and the latissimus dorsi connects

## Posterior (back) Muscle groups

- `Sternocleidomastoid`: Barely visible starting from the sides of the trapezius muscle and extending towards the front of the neck
- `Trapezius`: Major muscle of upper back extending from the base of the skull to the middle of the back while hugging the shoulder blades
  - as the scapula moves outwards or inwards, the trapezius muscle gets stretched or squished respectively
- `Deltoids`: Starts halfway on the spine of the scapula and extends towards the front of the upper arm
- `Infraspinatus`: The upper muscle in the scapula that begins at the inner edge and connects under the deltoids
- `Teres major`: The lower muscle in the scapula that also begins at the inner edge and connects under the deltoids slightly below the infraspinatus
  - when the arms are kept on the hip or behind the torso, it becomes especially sounded and prominent
- `Teres minor`: A smaller muscle that is mostly obscured under the Teres major muscle but also starts from the scapula and connects to the deltoid
- `Rhomboids`: A group of two muscle that connect the inner boundary of the scapula to the spine under the trapezius and is barely visible on the back unless the arms are raised
- `Latissimus dorsi`: The largest muscle in the body covering the lower back, and extends from below the trapezius towards the upper arm bone while covering the lower part of the scapula
  - it goes below the pectoralis and connects further up the upper arm bone
  - it covers both the serratus and the obliques in the back
  - the serratus however pushes the latissimus dorsi outwards slightly below the shoulder blade and slightly above where the latissimus dorsi tends to curve inwards to the back
  - in the inward section of the latissimus dorsi, there are two sausage shapes running along the back on either side of spine created by the spine itself
- `External obliques`: A major muscle that starts from under the latissimus dorsi and connects to the abdomen over the illiac spine of the pelvis
  - They lock in with the serratus and start from the ribs under the latissimus dorsi
- `Triceps`: A major muscle with three heads (two on the inner side and one on the outer) that covers the back of the upper arm and extends to the elbow on each side
  - They connect to the arm bone below the infraspinatus followed by teres minor, but before teres major and latissimus dorsi which is more towards the front of the arm
- `Extensor capi radialis longus`: A muscle on the forearm that begins at the outside of the elbow
- `Anconeus`: A small muscle directly below the elbow
- `Extensor digitorium`: A muscle that begins from below the extensor capi radialis longus and anconeus
- `Flexor carpi ulnaris`: A muscle on the forearm that begins at the inside of the elbow

## Armpits

- Armpits are a complex interplay of muscles
- They are visible when the arms are raised
- The more the arms are raised normally, the deltoid gets pushed further backwards and downwards
- The pectoralis gets stretched upwards from its connection point on the arm
- The biceps come out from below the pectoralis and stretch towards the elbow
- The lattissimus dorsi below and the teres major muscles go under the biceps and pectoralis where the bicep starts in the armpit
- The tricep heads come from between the teres major and teres minor and stretch towards the elbow
- Teres minor and infraspinatus are towards the back and connect to the arm bone under the deltoid
- The serratus become more visible under the pectoralis and latissimus dorsi muscles following the rib bones
